Public-domain assets for Collision Course
=========================================

Place your image files in this folder. The game currently looks for:

- assets/player_ship.png  → sprite for Player 1

You and your collaborator can download public-domain or CC0 spaceship art from sites like:
- `https://kenney.nl/assets`
- `https://opengameart.org`

After downloading, resize/crop the image as needed (around 50x50 pixels is a good starting size),
save it as `player_ship.png` in this folder, and run the game.
